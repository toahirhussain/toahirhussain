# 👋 Hi, I'm Toahir Hussain

I’m a Data Analyst / Data Scientist / Analytics Engineer with a strong foundation in data-driven problem solving, business intelligence, and machine learning. I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions, optimize performance, and create real-world impact.

### 🚀 What I Do

📊 Design and build end-to-end analytics and BI solutions using SQL, BigQuery, Power BI, and Python, from raw data ingestion to executive-ready dashboards.

🔎 Perform deep exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis to uncover patterns, risks, trends, and performance gaps in business data.

🤖 Build and evaluate machine learning models (classification, regression, forecasting) to solve real business problems like prediction, segmentation, and performance optimization.

📈 Create decision-focused dashboards and reports in Power BI with KPIs, drill-downs, and storytelling for stakeholders.

🧠 Translate business questions into analytical solutions by turning messy, complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive strategy and operations.
